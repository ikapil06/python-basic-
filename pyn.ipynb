    "# **`What is Python?`**\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with an elegant syntax that allows programmers to focus more on problem-solving than on syntax errors. One of the primary goals of Python Developers is to keep it fun to use. Python has become a big buzz in the field of modern software development, infrastructure management, and especially in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "            It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "# **`Why Python?`**\n",
    "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines   than some other programming languages.\n",
    "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "# **`Why Is Python Popular for Data Science?`**\n",
    "Data science is applicable in different industries, and it's helping to solve problems and discover more about the universe. In the health industry, data science helps doctors to make use of past data in making decisions, for example, diagnosis, or the right treatment for a disease. The education sector is not left out, you can now predict students dropping out of school, all thanks to data science.\n",
    "* Python Has a Simple Syntax\n",
    "* Wide Community as more people prefer working on python rather than R\n",
    "* Python Offers All the Libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.\n",

    "# **`Comments in Python`**\n",
    "As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called comments, and they are marked with the # symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed\n",
    "percentage = (minute * 100) / 60\n",

    "Everything from the # to the end of the line is ignored it has no effect on the program. The message is intended for the programmer or for future programmers who might use this code. In this case, it reminds the reader about the ever-surprising behavior of integer division.\n",

    "This sort of comment is less necessary if you use the integer division operation, //. It has the same effect as the division operator * Note, but it signals that the effect is deliberate.\n",

    "# Values and types\n",
    "A value is one of the fundamental things     like a letter or a number     that a program manipulates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 2 is an integer, and 'Hello, World!' is a string, because it contains a \"string\" of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.\n",
    "print(type('Hello, World!'))\n",
    "print(type(17))\n",
    "Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type str and integers belong to the type int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called float, because these numbers are represented in a format called floating-point.\n",

    "What about values like '17' and '3.2'? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings.\n",

    "They're strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in 1,000,000. This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is a legal expression:\n",
    "print (1,000,000100)\n",
    "Well, that's not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma-separated list of three integers, which it prints consecutively.

Though the code in example B isn’t wrong, the values that have been passed into the function are in the wrong order; thus, producing a result that does not match our desired output. Titanic.csv is the name of the project that is being worked on by the person, John, not the other way around.\n",
    "***Keyword arguments***\n",

    "\n",
    "With keyword arguments, as long as you assign a value to the parameter, the positions of the arguments do not matter.\n",

Python treats files differently as text or binary and this is important. Each line of code includes a sequence of characters and they form a text file. Each line of a file is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun.\n",
